# Data viz for mass spectrometry

Understanding how to compose plots using the grammar of graphics system of `ggplot` gives you an incredibly powerful vocabulary for creating a vast array of different plots from a basic tidy data frame.

Beyond the basic plots with which we're most familiar, many statistical methods for mass spectrometry require special care to visualize.

We'll be going over the best ways to visualize the following common methods of analyzing MS data:

- Clustering

  + Hierarchical clustering
  
  + K-means clustering
  
- Dimension reduction

  + Principal components analysis (PCA)
  
  + t-Distributed Stochastic Neighborhood Embedding (t-SNE)

- Heatmaps

- Visualizing statistics

  + P-value distributions
  
  + Volcano plots
  
  + Venn diagrams and UpSet plots

# Example data: iPRG

To practice visualization in R, we will use the following Proteome Informatics Research Group (iPRG) dataset.

This data is a spiked-in exeriment where 6 proteins were spiked at different ratios in a Yeast proteome background. Each run was repeated three times in a randomized order. The goal is to identify the differentially abundant spiked-in proteins.

>Choi M, et al. ABRF Proteome Informatics Research Group (iPRG) 2015 Study: Detection of Differentially Abundant Proteins in Label-Free Quantitative LC-MS/MS Experiments. J Proteome Res. 2017 Feb 3;16(2):945-957. doi: 10.1021/acs.jproteome.6b00881. PMID: 27990823.

First, we read in the raw data and annotations.

```{r message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

skydir <- "iPRG2015-Skyline"

raw <- read_csv(file.path(skydir, "Choi2017_DDA_Skyline_input.csv"), na="#N/A")
ann <- read_csv(file.path(skydir, "Choi2017_DDA_Skyline_annotation.csv"))
```

Then, we use MSstats to process the raw data.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(MSstats)

quant <- SkylinetoMSstatsFormat(raw, annotation = ann,
                                removeProtein_with1Feature = TRUE)
quant <- as_tibble(quant)
quant

processed.quant <- dataProcess(quant,
                               normalization="equalizeMedians",
                               summaryMethod="TMP",
                               cutoffCensored="minFeature",
                               censoredInt="0",
                               MBimpute=TRUE,
                               maxQuantileforCensored=0.999)

saveRDS(processed.quant, file="processed-iprg.rds")
```

Having used `saveRDS()` to save the data to "processed-iprg.rds", we can now load the processed data any time we want with `readRDS()`.

We do exactly that below, and then extract the run-level data.

```{r}
processed.quant <- readRDS("processed-iprg.rds")

iprg <- as_tibble(processed.quant$RunlevelData)

iprg
```

We further simplify the dataset to include only relevant columns.

```{r}
iprg <- transmute(iprg,
                  Protein,
                  Run=originalRUN,
                  Log2Intensity=LogIntensities,
                  Intensity=2^LogIntensities,
                  Condition=GROUP_ORIGINAL,
                  Subject=SUBJECT_ORIGINAL,
                  TechRep=stringr::str_sub(originalRUN, -5, -5))
iprg
```

The resulting data frame has 36,321 rows and 5 columns.

# Example data: CRC training

We will use the following colorectal cancer (CRC) dataset.

This data contains quantitative information for 72 proteins, including two standard proteins, *AIAG-Bovine* and *FETUA-Bovine*, that were targeted with SRM with isotope labeled reference peptides. The goal is to identify candidate biomarkers for non-invasive detection of CRC.

This training data includes 100 subjects in the control group and 100 subjects with CRC.

>Surinova, S. et al. (2015) Prediction of colorectal cancer diagnosis based on circulating plasma proteins. EMBO Mol. Med., 7, 1166â€“1178. doi: 10.15252/emmm.201404873. PMID: 26253081.

This data is available from the MSstatsBioData package.

```{r}
library(MSstatsBioData)
data(SRM_crc_training)
head(SRM_crc_training)
```

We use MSstats to obtain quantification data.

```{r eval=FALSE}
require(MSstats)

input.proposed <- dataProcess(SRM_crc_training,
                              normalization=FALSE,
                              summaryMethod="TMP",
                              cutoffCensored="minFeature", 
                              censoredInt="0", 
                              MBimpute=TRUE,
                              maxQuantileforCensored=0.999)

crc.quant <- quantification(input.proposed)

saveRDS(crc.quant, file="processed-crc.rds")
```

Having used `saveRDS()` to save the data to "processed-crc.rds", we can now load the processed data any time we want with `readRDS()`.

We do exactly that below.

Then, we need to coerce the quantification data to a numeric matrix with rows as samples and columns as proteins, impute missing values, and extract the diagnosis labels.

```{r}
crc.quant <- readRDS("processed-crc.rds")

crc <- t(as.matrix(crc.quant[,-1]))
colnames(crc) <- crc.quant$Protein

crc <- apply(crc, 2, function(x) ifelse(is.na(x), median(x, na.rm=TRUE), x))

crc[1:5, 1:5]

diagnosis <- sub("\\_.*", "", rownames(crc))
table(diagnosis)
```

# Graphics packages and plotting in base R

Many statistical packages will implement their own data visualization functions.

Some of these functions will use `ggplot2`, while others will use `lattice` or the base R graphics package.

Therefore, it's good to be somewhat familiar with the base R graphics plotting system, in case you use a package that requires it.

## "Brush on canvas"

The base R graphics system is very capable and convenient, but significantly less powerful and flexible than `ggplot2` for creating common plots.

It uses a "brush on canvas" approach, where we sequentially add graphical elements to a blank canvas, building up the plot with each command.

```{r}
plot(1:10, 1:10, col="blue")
lines(10:1, 1:10, col="red")
abline(v=5.5, col="green", lty=2)
```

The base has its own naming scheme for adjusting different graphical parameters (or aesthetics, as `ggplot` calls them):

| `ggplot2` | base |
|-----------|------|
| color | col |
| fill | col |
| shape | pch |
| size (points/text) | cex |
| size (lines) | lwd |
| linetype | lty |

## Recipes for common plots

### Scatter plot

```{r}
iprg2 <- iprg %>%
  select(Protein, Run, Intensity) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from=Run, values_from=Intensity)
iprg2
```

```{r}
plot(JD_06232014_sample1_C.raw ~ JD_06232014_sample1_B.raw,
     data=iprg2, log="xy")
```

### Line plot

```{r}
set.seed(1)
msraw <- as_tibble(Cardinal::simulateSpectrum())
msraw
```

```{r}
plot(intensity ~ mz, data=msraw, type='l')
```

### Box plot

```{r}
boxplot(Log2Intensity ~ Run, data=iprg)
```

### Histogram

```{r}
hist(iprg$Log2Intensity)
```

### Bar plot

```{r}
barplot(table(raw$ProductCharge))
```

# Clustering

Clustering can be a useful way to visualize and explore unlabeled data.

In clustering, and our goal is to find homogenous sub-groups within the data by grouping together data points based on similarity.

Clustering typically needs to be performed on a matrix of numeric data:

```{r}
crc[1:5, 1:5]
```

We will also use a simpler dataset consisting of measurements on iris flowers:

```{r}
head(iris)

iris_unique <- unique(iris)
iris_matrix <- as.matrix(iris_unique[,1:4])
```

## Hierarchical Clustering

Hierarchical clustering represents its clusters as a tree, or *dendrogram*. There are two main types of hierarchical clustering:

- __Agglomerative__: The "bottom-up" approach, where each data point begins as its own cluster, and clusters are iteratively merged until there is only a single cluster.

- __Iterations__: The "top-down" approach, where the dataset begins as a single cluster, and is iteratively split until each data point is its own cluster.

Different dissimilarity measures can be used to compare data points:

- Euclidean

- Pearson correlation

Additionally, different "linkages" define how dissimilarity is defined between clusters as a function of the pairwise dissimilarity between their data points:

- Complete-linkage (maximum distance)

- Single-linkage (minimum distance)

- Average (average of distances)

- Ward (minimize within-cluster variance)

### CRC

```{r}
hc <- hclust(dist(crc), method="complete")

plot(hc)
```

```{r message=FALSE}
library(dendextend)

dend <- as.dendrogram(hc)
dend.diagnosis <- diagnosis[order.dendrogram(dend)]
labels_colors(dend) <- c(CRC="red", Healthy="blue")[dend.diagnosis]

plot(dend)
```

```{r}
plot(crc, col=cutree(hc, k=2), pch=diagnosis)
```

### Iris

```{r}
iris_hc <- hclust(dist(iris_matrix), method="complete")

dend <- as.dendrogram(iris_hc)
dend.Species <- iris_unique$Species[order.dendrogram(dend)]
labels(dend) <- dend.Species
labels_colors(dend) <- c(setosa="black",
                         versicolor="red",
                         virginia="green")[dend.Species]

plot(dend)
```

## K-means clustering

K-means clustering is an iterative method that begins with a random cluster configuration, then (1) calculates the mean of each cluster, and (2) re-assigns data points to the cluster with the closest mean.

This process repeats until a set number of iterations are performed, or there are no (or very little) changes between iterations.

Because k-means is initialized with a random configuration, it will produce different results each time, so the random seed used to generate the clustering should be recorded for reproducibility.

## CRC

```{r}
km <- kmeans(crc, centers=2)

plot(crc, col=km$cluster, pch=diagnosis)
```

## Iris

```{r}
iris_km <- kmeans(iris_matrix, centers=3)

plot(iris_matrix, col=iris_km$cluster, pch=as.integer(iris_unique$Species))
```

One way to try to select the number of clusters is by plotting the total within-cluster sum-of-squares for different numbers of clusters and looking for an "elbow".

```{r}
ks <- 2:10

tot_within_ss <- sapply(ks, function(k) {
    cl <- kmeans(iris_matrix, k, nstart = 10)
    cl$tot.withinss
})

plot(ks, tot_within_ss, type = "b",
     main = "Selection of # of clusters for iris data",
     ylab = "Total within squared distances",
     xlab = "Values of k tested")
abline(v=3, col="green", lty=2)
```


# Dimension reduction

Dimension reduction can be used as a visualization technique for high-dimensional data, or to reduce the data size for input into a machine learning algorithm.

With dimension reduction, our goal is to transform the data into a small number of variables (features/dimensions) that represent as much information as in the original dataset as possible. These transformed variables and their weightings can then give insight into patterns in the data.



## Principal components analysis (PCA)

Principal components analysis is a classic dimension reduction method.

PCA can be calculated in a number of ways, including eigendecomposition of the correlation/covariance matrix or performing SVD on the data matrix.

PCA produces new *orthogonal* (non-correlated) dimensions that are linear combinations of the original data.

That is, the new variables are weighted combinations of the original variables.

## CRC

```{r}
pc <- prcomp(crc)

summary(pc)

plot(pc)
```

```{r}
biplot(pc)
```

```{r}
var <- pc$sdev^2

pcve <- var/sum(var)

cumsum(pcve)
```

```{r}
plot(pc$x, col=factor(diagnosis))
```

## Iris

```{r}
iris_pc <- prcomp(iris_matrix)

summary(iris_pc)

plot(iris_pc$x, col=iris_unique$Species)
```


## t-Distributed Stochastic Neighborhood Embedding (t-SNE)

The t-Distributed Stochastic Neighborhood Embedding algorithm is a stochastic, nonlinear dimension reduction method.

It uses probability distributions to try to bring more similar data points together, while leaving dissimilar data points far apart.

Because t-SNE is stochastic, it will produce different results each time, so the random seed used to generate the embedding should be recorded for reproducibility.

The algorithm requires two parameters:

- __Perplexity__: balances global and local aspects of the data

- __Iterations__: number of iterations before the clustering is stopped

## CRC

```{r}
library(Rtsne)

tsne <- Rtsne(crc, perplexity=3)

set.seed(1)
plot(tsne$Y, col=factor(diagnosis))
```

## Iris

```{r}
set.seed(2)
iris_tsne <- Rtsne(iris_matrix, perplexity=30)

plot(iris_tsne$Y, col=iris_unique$Species)
```

# Heatmaps

Heatmaps are a common way of visualizing matrices of expressions or intensities.

They are typically accompanied by hierarchical clustering on both dimensions that serve to arrange the rows and columns based on similarity.

## CRC

```{r}
heatmap(crc, RowSideColors=ifelse(diagnosis=="CRC", "red", "blue"))
```

Despite their common use, and their ability to give a high-level overview of a large dataset, there are often better visualizations that are more useful.

## Iris

```{r}
heatmap(iris_matrix, labRow=iris_unique$Species)
```

# Visualizing statistics

After performing statistical analysis, we will always need to visualize our results, for interpretation and presentation.

First, to generate some statistical results, let's perform statistical comparison tests between all of the conditions in the iPRG dataset.

Below, we set up the constrasts and then use MSstats to do the comparisons.

```{r eval=FALSE}
comparison1 <- matrix(c(-1,1,0,0),nrow=1)
comparison2 <- matrix(c(-1,0,1,0),nrow=1)
comparison3 <- matrix(c(-1,0,0,1),nrow=1)
comparison4 <- matrix(c(0,-1,1,0),nrow=1)
comparison5 <- matrix(c(0,-1,0,1),nrow=1)
comparison6 <- matrix(c(0,0,-1,1),nrow=1)

comparison <- rbind(comparison1, comparison2, comparison3,
                    comparison4, comparison5, comparison6)

rownames(comparison) <- c("C2-C1", "C3-C1", "C4-C1",
                           "C3-C2", "C4-C2", "C4-C3")

comparison.tests <- MSstats::groupComparison(contrast.matrix=comparison,
                                         data=processed.quant)

tests <- comparison.tests$ComparisonResult

saveRDS(tests, file="tests-iprg.rds")
```

Having used `saveRDS()` to save the data to "tests-iprg.rds", we can now load the comparison data any time we want with `readRDS()`.

We do exactly that below, and then extract the results.

```{r}
tests <- readRDS("tests-iprg.rds")

tests <- as_tibble(tests)

tests
```

## P-value distributions

```{r}
ggplot(tests, aes(x=pvalue)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth=0.01) +
  labs(x="P-values", y="count",
       title="P-values distribution w/ slight enrichment of small P-values") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Volcano plots

```{r}
tests %>%
  mutate(Significance=ifelse(adj.pvalue < 0.05, "P < .05", "P â‰¥ .05")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=log2FC, y=-log10(adj.pvalue))) +
  geom_point(aes(color=Significance)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept=-log10(0.05), linetype="dotted") +
  geom_vline(xintercept=c(-1, 1), linetype="dotted") +
  labs(x=expression(log[2]~fold-change),
       y=expression(-log[10]~adjusted~p-value),
       title="Volcano plot with reference lines") +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
tests %>%
  mutate(Significance=ifelse(adj.pvalue < 0.05, "P < .05", "P â‰¥ .05")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=log2FC, y=-log10(adj.pvalue))) +
  geom_text(data=filter(tests, adj.pvalue < .05),
            mapping=aes(label=paste0(Protein, ":", Label))) +
  geom_point(aes(color=Significance)) +
  labs(x=expression(log[2]~fold-change),
       y=expression(-log[10]~adjusted~p-value),
       title="Volcano plot with labeled points") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Intersections

Let's visualize which proteins were found to be significant in more than one of our comparisons.

```{r}
signif <- filter(tests, adj.pvalue < 0.05)
signif_sets <- tapply(signif$Protein, signif$Label, as.character)
```

### Venn diagrams

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(gplots)
venn(signif_sets[1:2])
```

```{r warning=FALSE}
venn(signif_sets[1:3])
```

```{r message=FALSE}
library(eulerr)
plot(euler(signif_sets[1:2]), quantities=TRUE)
```

```{r}
plot(euler(signif_sets[1:3]), quantities=TRUE)
```

### UpSet plots

```{r}
library(UpSetR)

upset(fromList(signif_sets), order.by = "freq")
```

```{r}
upset(fromList(signif_sets), order.by = "degree")
```

```{r}
upset(fromList(signif_sets), sets=names(signif_sets)[1:3])
```

```{r}
upset(fromList(signif_sets),
      sets=names(signif_sets)[1:3],
      empty.intersections = "on")
```

# Session info

```{r session-info}
sessionInfo()
```
