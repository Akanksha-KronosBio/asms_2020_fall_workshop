#### Questions for Part I ####

## Q1: Answer the following questions about the pig 206 dataset: 
# Q1a: how many spectra?
# Q1b: how many features?
# Q1c: which m/z range?
# Q1d: Profile or centroided spectra? 

## Q2: Answer the following questions about the subsetted intensity matrix: 
# Q2a: Which row -column  pair has the highest intensity in this data subset?
# Q2b: which mz and coordinates do they correspond to?

## Q3: Plot more visualizations
# Q3a: Choose one more mz value by zooming into the average spectrum and plot the ion images for it
# Q3b: Explore the fine tuning options for the ion images (?Cardinal::image), choose different plotting settings to smooth the image, enhace the contrast, change m/z window range etc. 

#### Questions for Part II ####

## Q4: preprocessing parameters and visualizations
# Q4a: Plot the number of peaks per spectrum after pre-processing as heatmap
# Q4b: set SNR to 5, how many m/z peaks will be picked? 

#### Questions for Part III ####

## Q5: Find out which class corresponds to brain and liver and find the top m/z feature and plot their ion images
