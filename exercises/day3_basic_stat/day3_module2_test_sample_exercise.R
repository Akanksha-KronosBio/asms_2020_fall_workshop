# x-axis : log 2 fold change estimate,
# y-axis : -log10(adj.pvalue)
# add horizontal line at -log10(0.1)
# add vertical line at fold change = 1.5
# fix the range of x-axis : -8 to 8
# add title 'Comparison between condition3 and condition4'
# add protein name to dots, if proteins are significantly different between two groups
# change dot colot : red if significance, otherwise grey
